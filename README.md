### **FEW BASIC GIT HUB COMMANDS** 

## git init
This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.

## git add
Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.

## git commit
Itâ€™s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.

## git config
To set the basic configurations on github like your name and email.

## git help
Take help from github help section for different commands and other errors .

## git clone
Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example)

## git branch
We can use the git branch command for creating, listing and deleting branches.

## git status
The Git status command gives us all the necessary information about the current branch. 

## git push
After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.

## git pull
The git pull command is used to get updates from the remote repo. This command is a combination of git fetch and git merge which means that, when we use git pull, it gets the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and immediately applies the latest changes in your local (git merge).

## git revert
Sometimes we need to undo the changes that we've made. There are various ways to undo our changes locally or remotely (depends on what we need), but we must carefully use these commands to avoid unwanted deletions.

## git merger
Git merge basically integrates your feature branch with all of its commits back to the dev (or master) branch.
